   1.  Built a one search for all apps(enterprise) with my friend. https://github.com/Light-AI-Labs

   3.  Had a small drop-shipping business.
   4.  Made a 2D mobile game using unity, sadly it had to leave it midway. But here's a glimpse of it https://twitter.com/shivamsinghssb/status/715617028254490624
